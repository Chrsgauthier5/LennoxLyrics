Uh-huh, life's like this
Uh-huh, uh-huh, that's the way it is
'Cause life's like this
Uh-huh, uh-huh, that's the way it is

Chill out, what you yelling for?
Lay back, it's all been done before
And if you could only let it be
You would see

I like you the way you are
When we're driving in your car
And you're talking to me, one on one
But you become

Somebody else 'round everyone else
You're watching your back like you can't relax
You're trying to be cool
You look like a fool to me
Tell me

Why do you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're acting like you're somebody else
Gets me frustrated
Life's like this, you

You fall, and you crawl, and you break
And you take what you get, and you turn it into honesty
Promise me I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no
